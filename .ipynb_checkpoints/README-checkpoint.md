# Bank-Loan-Web-App
This is a web product for loan approvals in banks. The motivation for this project is to bring the machine learning on the client side to improve user experience. The backend is developed using python and django and the front end is developed using CSS. BootStrap &amp; react


### Machine Learning:
I commited the data wrangling notebook. It contains some data preprocessing, EDA and data cleaning for model ingestion. I also commited a neural network model developed in Keras and pickled the model params into the loan_model.pkl. I use the pickled model to test production data. N.B. The production data is artificially engineered based on randomness. 

### Python Backend:
Python django rest framework was used to create the application, handle get and post requsts and set up model in SQLite database.
