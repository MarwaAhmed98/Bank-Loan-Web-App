# RougeBank Fintech App
A new approach to banking technology that's fast, accurate and more agileðŸš€. Get your loan applocations approved faster and have the flexibility to learn from your customers as you grow. I present to you, ROugeBank loan app, a progressive web application powered by artifical intelligence to deliver loan applications faster. 

## Technology Stack
This application is developed in Python3. The stack is divided into three components:
1. Machine learning using python sikcit-learn 
2. Django web framework for backend development
3. HTML and CSS for frontend development

### Machine Learning:
I commited the data wrangling notebook. It contains some data preprocessing, EDA and data cleaning for model ingestion. I also commited a neural network model developed in Keras and pickled the model params into the loan_model.pkl. I use the pickled model to test production data. N.B. The production data is artificially engineered based on randomness. 

### Python Backend:
Python django rest framework was used to create the application, handle get and post requsts and set up model in SQLite database.
